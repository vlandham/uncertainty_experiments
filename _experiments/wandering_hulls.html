<p>
  Here, we use the idea that events of more uncertain geo precision "wander" more around their indicated center or region.
</p>

<p>
  As quick examples, here are wandering hulls for the 3 different levels of geo precision.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="hull1"></div>
    <p class="caption">Region Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="hull2"></div>
    <p class="caption">Area Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="hull3"></div>
    <p class="caption">Town Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The initial position of the hull is not well thought out in these experiments, and could be improved. The methodology of how the hull wanders could also be modified.
</p>

<p>
  Opacity could be used to deal with overlap.
