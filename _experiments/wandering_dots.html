<h3>Metaphors/Techniques</h3>

<p>
  In this experiment, dots represent events that have occurred in a region.
</p>

<p>
  The higher the uncertainty, the larger the spatial region, and thus, the further the dots wander. The metaphor here is about events "spreading out" over their possible locations.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dot1"></div>
    <p class="caption">Region Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dot2"></div>
    <p class="caption">Area Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dot3"></div>
    <p class="caption">Town Level Uncertainty</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The above use a consistent number of dots to "fill" in an area. The number of dots could also be associated with a metric - such as event count or fatality count.
</p>

<p>
  Here are three more wandering dot displays, each using the same region size, but different numbers of dots
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dotc1"></div>
    <p class="caption">Region With 200 Dots</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dotc2"></div>
    <p class="caption">Region With 100 Dots</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="dotc3"></div>
    <p class="caption">Region With 10 Dots</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Right now, no opacity is used. Overlap with opacity could be a future experiment.
